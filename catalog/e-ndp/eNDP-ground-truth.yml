transcription-guidelines: >-
 - The abbreviations have been resolved, both those by suspension (facimꝰ --->
 facimus) and by contraction (dñi --> domini). Likewise, those using
 conventional signs (⁊ --> et ; ꝓ --> pro) have been resolved. 

 - The named entities (names of persons, places and institutions) have been
 capitalized. The beginning of a block of text as well as the original capitals
 used by the notary are also capitalized.

 The consonantal i and u characters have been transcribed as j and v in both
 French and Latin.

 - The punctuation marks used in the text: . and / have been transcribed, but
 the transcription has not been standardized with modern punctuation.

 - Corrections and words that appear cancelled in the manuscript have been
 transcribed surrounded by the sign $ at the beginning and at the end.

 - More specific transcription rules can be found into the file
 transcription_guidelines.pdf on Zenodo repository.
